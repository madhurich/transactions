------
when you chnaged teh directive definition, to
aangular.module('a.b', [])
	.directive('some', some);//in index first load this directive

angular.module('a.b')
		.controller('someCtrl', someCtrl)

while including this in index, first you need to include the directive file and then 
the controller attached to this directive.
